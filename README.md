# LinkedList

Program to get the reverse order of the first 100 fibonacci numbers as a linked list. 

First the fibonacci numbers are created and stored in a linked list. This is the input for the function `reverse_order_llist(llist)`. This method reads the linked list from the root to the end while the data is always added to the root of a new linked list. The result is a linked list in reverse order.

Run `main.py`.

Output: Prints the data of the fibonacci linked list and the linked list in reverse order.
